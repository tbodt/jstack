{"name":"JStack","tagline":"A reimplementation of a Java stack data structure.","body":"The `Stack` class in the Java library has some problems. It inherits from `Vector`, so it is very easy to insert elements into the middle of the stack:\r\n\r\n    stack.insertElementAt(new Object(), 0);\r\n\r\nThat would insert an `Object` at the *bottom* of the stack. Not the top, where elements are supposed to go.\r\n\r\nThe stack in JStack doesn't work like that. It has its own inheritance hierarchy of classes, designed the same way as the rest of the Java Collections Framework. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
